          A front-end developer with a passion for turning ideas into clean, interactive web experiences. I specialize in building responsive 
          websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I enjoy creating designs that feel just as good as they look. Whether I’m working 
          on a simple landing page or a dynamic web app, I focus on clean code, smooth user flows, and thoughtful design. When I’m not coding, 
          I enjoy learning new tech, collaborating with others, and staying inspired by what’s possible on the web.
